Folder Contents
This folder contains .PLY files in binary format. These files represent scans performed using LiDAR technology and are categorized based on the scanning angle:

Files labeled with "NOH":

Represent scans performed at a non-overhead angle (not directly above the bins).
Files labeled with "OH":

Represent scans performed as directly overhead as the situation allowed.
These files are further labeled with the respective bin number they contain scans of.
Please refer to the file naming conventions for clarity on the type and source of each scan.
